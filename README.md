Repo for storing automations for bulbs, etc.

# TODO: Migrate to Home Assistant API
[Docs](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/home-assistant-api-turn-on-off-light-via-simple-http-command-from-other-device/75098/5)

This repo was only created to centralize the communication with different providers of bulbs.
If I manage to use HA API, I can delete this repo and replace it with simple cURL invocations.
